# OpenAI Gym Taxi Project
This is an OpenAI Gym project that simulates a taxi driving scenario. The objective is to use reinforcement learning to teach the agent how to pick up and drop off passengers in the shortest possible time while obeying traffic rules.

## Environment
The environment provides a grid-world setting where the agent can move around picking and dropping off passengers at different locations. The agent receives a reward for each successful drop-off and is penalized for violating traffic rules. The environment also includes a passenger generation mechanism that spawns new passengers at random locations, making the task more challenging.

## Requirements
Python 3.8 or higher
OpenAI Gym library
numpy library
